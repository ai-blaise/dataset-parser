"""
Diff Indicator utilities for calculating and displaying JSON differences.

This module provides functions to calculate differences between original
and processed JSON records, specifically designed for parser_finale transformations.

Diff Types:
    - unchanged: Values match exactly
    - changed: Value differs between original and processed
    - removed: Key exists in original but not in processed
    - added: Key exists in processed but not in original

    Calculate differences between original and processed JSON structures.

    This function recursively compares two JSON structures and identifies
    differences, returning a mapping of JSON paths to diff types.

    Handles parser_finale-specific transformations:
        - Assistant message content is emptied to ""
        - reasoning_content field is removed from assistant messages
        - Extra fields not in the schema are removed

    Args:
        original: The original JSON record.
        processed: The processed JSON record (after parser_finale).
        path: The current path prefix (used for recursion).
        depth: Current recursion depth (used to prevent stack overflow).

    Returns:
        A dictionary mapping JSON paths to diff types:
            - "unchanged": Values match exactly
            - "changed": Value differs between original and processed
            - "removed": Key exists in original but not in processed
            - "added": Key exists in processed but not in original

    Examples:
