"""
Dual Pane Mixin for left/right panel switching functionality.

Provides consistent panel switching behavior across dual-pane screens:
- action_switch_panel(): Toggle between left and right panels
- action_vim_left(): Switch focus to left panel (vim h key)
- action_vim_right(): Switch focus to right panel (vim l key)
- _update_panel_styles(): Update active/inactive CSS classes on panels
- _focus_active_widget(): Abstract method subclasses must implement

Usage:
    # IMPORTANT: DualPaneMixin MUST come before VimNavigationMixin in MRO
    # so that action_vim_left/right (panel switching) takes precedence.
